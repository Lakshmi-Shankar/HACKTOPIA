# Problem Statement : “ How might we spark interest in reading books among people who find it unappealing and overwhelming?

***Why do we choose this ?***

Most of the people don’t consider this as a big problem because all thinks that reading is only for gaining knowledge and putting food to our brain, we feels  it is beyond that in our day-to-day lifestyle.

lets see the main importance here :

-	Reading books is a powerful tool for personal, intellectual, and emotion growth. It’s not about knowledge but about shaping a better version of ourselves.

**Why don’t people read?**

-	They find books boring or too long.
-	They feel they don’t have much time to read.
-	Reading feels like work rather than fun.
-	They prefer short, interactive , content [social media, gaming, videos].
